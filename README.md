# Flux Browser

Flux is a lightweight Chromium-based desktop browser built with Electron.

This project is mainly for learning how real browsers work under the hood —
from window creation to web rendering and navigation control.

## Current features
- Native desktop window
- Chromium webview rendering
- Address bar with navigation
- Back / forward / reload
- URL syncing (works with SPA sites like YouTube)

## Status
Early development. Tabs and more features coming soon.
